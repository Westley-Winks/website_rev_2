I am excited about joining the team as a developer educator on the machine learning team. I made a video for you all to add to my application. In this quick video, I show how easy it is for any creator to add captions to their content using AssemblyAI.

On top of this, I have two relevant ongoing projects that make me an ideal candidate:

1. Firstly, I just started an email newsletter (new posts each week!) where I write about various pieces of technology that I am currently experiencing. I have pieces planned for the future that focus more on machine learning and different frameworks I am using. Through this, I am actively improving my writing skills and my ability to explain difficult things to others. You can view <a href="https://untilitsnotfun.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website I built</a> or <a href="https://untilitsnotfun.com/posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous posts</a>.

2. I am developing a curriculum to teach Python to high-schoolers in my local community. My area is very blue collar and I want to help the teenagers that don't want to follow that path. I want to show them that coding can be fun and a legit career path. I pitched my idea to a local center and I am partnering with them to gather students on Monday nights to teach and it is set to launch in May. Unfortunately, I don't have any evidence as it is still being developed. I want to release the content on <a href="https://github.com/Westley-Winks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my GitHub</a> sequentially as we learn more each week. Stay tuned for that!

Please browse my website to get a feel for my experience and follow the links to <a href="https://github.com/Westley-Winks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/westley-winks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> accounts for more information. I look forward to talking with you about this opportunity and to answer any questions you have. Thank you very much and have a great day!
