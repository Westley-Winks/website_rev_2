  name: "Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language"
  description: Language (more specifically, how we communicate) is a living and breathing thing that changes with time. That next phase for human communication is through the internet. On the internet, we don't have the luxury of using rising intonation or facial expressions to convey meaning but people come up with creative ways to convey the same information. We build new characters, emojis, and memes all to better understand and love one another.

  description: Wheelan makes statistics fun and applicable through real examples. It really helped me reinforce the idea of thinking probabilistically and goes hand in hand with the thoughts in "Drunkard's Walk" by Leonard Mlodinow. Is it people's choices that determine their outcome or are they the 5% that isn't accounted for in a 95% confidence interval?

  description: Lots of fun facts and factoids, all broken into fun bite-sized chapters. Almost as good as the podcast but Green's voice and long pauses add a lot of emotion and human touch to the stories. This book weaves between fascinating, moving, awe-inspiring, saddening all within pages from one another. And at the end, you get plenty of trivia for your next Jeopardy! event or party...if your friends are into that kind of thing.
