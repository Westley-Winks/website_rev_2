  description: A story about regret and what matters most in life told in the craziest way possible. By traveling to other worlds and paths not taken, Jason Dessen evades insanity to find his true identity and his true meaning. Crouch has a very unique, missing-pronoun writing style that adds to one of the themes of the book; Who am *I*? Who is *she*? Who are *we*?

  description: Extraordinary. Very similar to *The Martian* by the same author, but the stakes are higher. Instead of everyone on Earth trying to save one person, it is one person trying to save everyone on Earth. Weir's characters are a marvel and no matter how bad a situation is, their problem-solving abilities always save the day.

  description: Incredible writing and journalism from Perlroth about hackers, exploits, and the clandestine cyber-arms race. My hometown of about 9,000 people *almost* made it into the book. Iranian hackers tried to open Bowman Dam in New York (it was 20 feet tall and disconnected that day for maintenance). One theory is that they were trying to hit the much more significant Bowman Dam on the Crooked River about 10 miles from my childhood home in Prineville. "The dam, 245 feet tall and 800 feet long, holds back 150,000 acre-feet of water from inundating 10,000 residences in downstream Pineville." ... Pineville. So close.

  description: Language (more specifically, how we communicate) is a living and breathing thing that changes with time. That next phase for human communication is through the internet. On the internet, we don't have the luxury of using rising intonation or facial expressions to convey meaning but people come up with creative ways to convey the same information. We build new characters, emojis, and memes all to better understand and love one another.

  description: Wheelan makes statistics fun and applicable through real examples. It really helped me reinforce the idea of thinking probabilistically and goes hand in hand with the thoughts in "Drunkard's Walk" by Leonard Mlodinow. Is it people's choices that determine their outcome or are they the 5% that isn't accounted for in a 95% confidence interval?

  description: Lots of fun facts and factoids, all broken into fun bite-sized chapters. Almost as good as the podcast but Green's voice and long pauses add a lot of emotion and human touch to the stories. This book weaves between fascinating, moving, awe-inspiring, saddening all within pages from one another. And at the end, you get plenty of trivia for your next Jeopardy! event or party...if your friends are into that kind of thing.

Sleeping keeps us alive and allows us to learn, remember, and be creative. It is one of the most important activities we do and yet it feels like a burden or a waste of time. Walker describes this importance as well as actionable tips on how to sleep better.
