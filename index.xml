      <description>I am excited about joining the team as a machine learning engineer. I made a quick video explaining why I want to join, what I bring to the table, and how we can create a win-win together. Thanks for watching!
   Please browse my website to get a feel for my experience and follow the links to my GitHub and LinkedIn accounts for more information. I look forward to talking with you about this opportunity and to answer any questions you have.</description>
